# Eviction Address Entry Guide

## Overview

The goal of this project is to accurately transcribe addresses from
court documents so community partners can use this information to
quickly respond to situations of need. This document should help explain
the process and make it easy to get started.

## Address Entry Interface

There is currently a bug where after successfully submitting a verified
address the dialog box goes away but the case does not refresh. Simply
press “New Case” and you should see a new case number along with a
decrease in the number of cases remaining to be transcribed.

## Court Documents

Court records are stored on
[OSCN](https://www.oscn.net/dockets/Search.aspx). Usually people type in
whatever information they have about a case, whether the case number
itself, or simply the name of a party involved in the case. This would
bring up case information and a list of any documents associated with
the case.

For our purposes, we are interested in the document with the code
**FEDS**. This stands for **Forcible Entry Detainer Served**, and is
where the address of interest is located.

### Sample

## Entry

Some addresses in Tulsa County are… weird.

There can be ‘half’ street numbers. Often times people mis attribute the
1/2 to the street *name* rather than *number*. See the screen shots
below. Including the 1/2 in the street number correctly validates, while
including it in the street name fails.
